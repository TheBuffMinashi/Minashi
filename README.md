ðŸŒŽ I'm an AI Engineer from and I currently live in Mashhad, Iran.


I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to FastAPI, Typer, and my other open source projects. At the same time, I'm also helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an external consultant. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to contact me. ðŸ¤“

If my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also sponsor my work on them. â˜•
